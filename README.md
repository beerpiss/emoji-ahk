This is an AHK script to automatically replace your emojis from their shortcodes (`:emoji_name:` in platforms like Discord, Slack, GitHub) anywhere on your machine.

You type `:smiling_face_with_tear:` and it automagically converts to ðŸ¥²!

It supports all emojis available in Discord, or [this table](https://projects.iamcal.com/emoji-data/table.htm) depends on what shortcode type you use.

## Download
